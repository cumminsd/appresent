# appresent

Appresent is a JavaScript framework for single-page, animated and zooming presentations. This is *beta* code, lacking complete tests or documentation.
Although I've been using it for several years now in large conference settings, use at your own risk!

I will eventually post some demos. For now, features:

* Presentations are driven by a simple JSON "script" that can be controlled by keyboard, swiping, or driven remotely.
* Animations in CSS3, with low-level style manipulation.
* Animations can be time-based or delayed, including reveals, rotations, and pans.
* Presenter controls for syncing, brightness and contrast adjustment, and authentication.
* Simple broadcasting backend in Node.js.
